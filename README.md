The entire project is divided into 4 assignments:  

    * asgn1: Lexers
    * asgn2: Reading 3-Address code and producing its x86 equivalent
    * asgn3: Custom Grammar for java
    * asgn4: Producing Intermediate Representation while parsing using attributes

The Final_project directory contains the completed project, which combined all aspects of previous assignments to produce a pretty good compiler.
